<h1>The Purpose of Anger</h1>
<h2>2/12/21</h2>

<p>
When I was a child, we had a decently large sized backyard with a pool, surrounded by tight fencing. A row of tall pine trees lined one side, and a row of hedges two others. The back corner was thick with lush ivy. For at least two successive years, a pair of ducks nested there in the springtime. I don't remember ever seeing any ducklings or eggs. They certainly had to go somewhere else for food. Perhaps they just liked the fenced in, secluded space.
</p>
<p>
I believe ducks tend to mate monogomously, for life, and so these were likely a couple. One was a light brown female, and the other a bold drake. Mallards, with striking purple armbands. What's up with those armbands?
</p>
<p>
Anyway I liked to watch the ducks in the backyard from inside. Once, on a warm sunny day, I approached them with some pieces of bread. I was noticed by the female, who stood proudly and waddled quickly toward me with its mouth open. I surely looked an idiot standing there, hunched forward, my stupid fingers surrounding the airy piece of Stroehmann from all sides. The territorial beast bit down hard. The vision of its dark alien eyes, its tiny, strangely ridged teeth carved into the solid bill, and assertive stance burned into my mind along with that pain. I did not bleed, though I was a soft little boy with a soft boy's fingers and a soft boy's heart. I cried and went in.
</p>
<p>
What was her intention? To eat delicious bread from a god's hand? Or to drive this foolish idiot demon from her home? Perhaps neither. Perhaps both.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that, in the school of Hard Ducks, one must be an opportunist. One must be quick to rear back, flap one's wings and hiss, and just generally show everyone who's the boss here. One must bite the hand that feeds you, and take the hand and hold it up. As it bleeds down your foreharm, you issue a decree to everyone across the land. From this day forth, everyone will come to you with bread, and when they do so you will tear them apart one by one without the subtlest indication of gratitude. You will then feast on the bread and the entrails.
</p>
<p>
So what was this duck thinking? Or, what was she <em>feeling?</em> I doubt she was on some kind of power trip, or just "likes" to harrass little kids and leave them completely "messed up when it comes to birds." No, she was likely simply acting on instinct. The evolutionary benefits of territoriality, as well as aggressive grain acquisition, are clear.
</p>
<p>
Fear and aggression are, in humans, regulated by the amygdala, and probably the thalamus? And pituitary maybe. I bet everything's kind of involved, since people can be jerks in deviously clever ways. Benzodiazepenes turn that amygdala right the heck off. I think. I have pieced this together from some podcasts. But the point is, we got these parts of the brain that are <em>ancient as all getout.</em> The midbrain is sometimes called the reptilian brain, as it is mostly complete as early in the tree of life as those guys. Maybe even earlier? Like in frogs and eels and stuff?
</p>
<p>
But whatever, I don't know, the point is, birds have them, because we both share some kind of reptile as a common ancestor. So it's really likely that birds feel the same way about being grumpy and hungry and ascared as we do. The experience is likely quite similar. So turkeys and ducks and all the birds probably get angry the same way people do. This is useful information to have at your command when empathizing with ducks.
</p>
<p>
How can we use the state of things to achieve our goals? The first step is in assessing the information and tools currently at our disposal. We must analyze anger and hate. Now, mammals have this extra chunk of cerebral cortex. We attribute most of our humanity and higher functions to this outer region of the brain, enveloping the reptilian brain. This includes the skillfull tasks, including the ability to learn, focus, evaluate, calculate, percieve, memorize, and to be self-aware. All that big brain stuff. Birds do not have this cortex, but they do have an <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6511/eabc5534">advanced pallium, which is in the same location, is wired similarly, and allows for similar higher level thought-tasks</a>, so why we bother making a distinction is beyond me. If you're a scientist please send me an email at ducksemailaddress at gmail doc com.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that <em>hate</em> involves a lot of this cortical area, along with the inner part. Hate can be cold, passionless. Not always of course. But slow-burning plans for revenge or the seething reaction to an icon representing your enemy both seem to involve conscious thought and memory. But quick irritation, lashing out after an annoyance, fear for one's or one's tribe's life and safety, being "hangry," these are the feelings I assume we share with duckkind. These developed long long ago, when the earliest animals needed a burst of energy to escape or defeat their enemies and live to see another day.
</p>
<p>
Usually we don't need these feelings nowatimes. Many cultures feature prominent ideologies about pushing them down. People devote themselves to repression. Not necessarily unhealthy repression, as in denying their existence altogether, though. Analysis of their function will allow us to take advantage of them for glory and honor.
</p>
<p>
So. Someone has ticked you off. You're angry. And the physiological effects of being a grumpygus benefit action. The heart beats quickly, adrenaline flows, and muscles tense in preparation for quick and powerful movement. So we will consider the possibilities of how they will be used in the simplest comprehensive cases: 1) you intend to do harm, 2) you do not intend to do harm, or 3) you are not decided. I am quick to think the last of these is the most common in nature. Cautious indecision is another useful strategy in the wild, where it is best not to burn any bridges when encountering a new duck or person. It is another strategy that has lost value in the modern world of intricate planning. I will first explore the first two options, with the concession that the third is also in some sense a state of considering the others.
</p>
<p>
So, you intend to do harm. The anger makes sense. You're ready to fight. You're ready to defend. You're ready to eat. Unless I had a cold, calculating, and psychopathic duck living in my backyard, this was its state of mind. It was hauling toward me, to get me out of there probably. I am a scary dude getting all up ins! But in the modern world of humans, the plan to hurt anyone in the first place is psychopathic. So, let us assume you are angry, and you are good intentioned. Then you do not wish to inflict harm on a person except as a last resort. We have already lost most of the benefits of anger's physiological effects. This is the challenge to the gentleperson of today.
</p>
<p>
We can learn to control our anger, but rarely to dismiss it altogether. For the duck, deciding not to inflict harm can still be beneficial. The appearance of an angry duck alone is enough to make anyone second guess their choice to wander through their marshlands. The duck is banking on the observer concluding it's a powerful and dangerous duck based on its body language. This further divides the tree of options for anger's purpose: it signals to another the state of mind. A duck's enemy may back down given the threat of the duck. It chooses not to take the risk. The duck may intend to harm, or defend, but one cannot be sure. The duck sees the backdown, the situation deescalates. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to providing a chance out of the situation, the enemy themselves provides body language which the duck can then interpret. With deescalation, scurrying off, the duck can return to normal life comfortably without worry. If the threat stands their ground, or charges, the duck can then be ready to act along its fight or flight options. In this case, flight can be literal, as ducks have wings with which they can fly away, <em>through the air</em>.
</p>
<p>
Again, I will assume that the desire to commit physical harm is only an option to a person in a rational state of mind only in the most dire of circumstances. Our society just doesn't like it when you hurt people. It's not good. I'm gonna say that again: it's not good to hurt people. There are almost always better options in our daily lives. But we still have the instinct. When someone has done you wrong, you pace, you grip your fists, you clench your teeth, you go for a walk, you take a nice shower, you watch The Office and eat popcorn and just generally try to forget about it for a while, but all the physiological stuffs still happen. Once they do, we must then deal with it unnaturally. 
</p>
<p>
But Unnature is quite powerful. We have conquered the world twenty-eightfold with it. We can use our 21st century minds, wielding the golden blades of Logic and Compassion to enact the correct choice. So if you are angry, it is most useful for signaling your state of mind.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with this on its own, but we must consider intentions. If yours is to threaten, hoping the enemy will back down, then that is it alone. You are relying on making them feel scared and threatened. This is viable, but rarely safe, and also just kind of crappy of you.
</p>
<p>
The secondary effect, of being ready to defend yourself, remains useful. However, the same thought processes are likely going through the other party's mind as well. In this case, any hostile stance of yours will be re- and re-flected upon. If you are angry and they are not, you are relying on their empathy to change. This is what I believe happens the most often in the modern world: that anger is a form of whining, and is used to bargain for change. You are banking on the other person wanting you to not be angry, or at least not to be annoyed by the fact that you are. So they make a change. This is also kind of crappy of you.
</p>
<p>
So, you can threaten someone to show your prowess and confidence in battle, instilling fear and submission. You can also hope they're a softie and will do whatever it takes to calm you down. You live in a bleak world powered by threats and manipulation.
</p>
<p>
There is a chance out of this, however. While we consider these emotions as the basest processes of human mind, from a biological standpoint they are bewilderingly sophisticated. Anger, empathy, and their interpretation even across the divide between species provides an out. It means you don't have to test warrior prowess at every antagonistic interaction. There is value there. The loser can still survive, and go away, rather than be potentially ripped apart (and torn to bloody shreds) any time they stumble into the wrong nest. There is honor in this structure.
</p>
<p>
In the same way, we can construct a bureaucracy of thought which acts as a buffer to anger, as anger can act as a buffer to violence. We must train and train to control our anger, so that we may choose to use it, or not to. We must learn to control these emotions through strict mental training and meditation. In the event of the need for anger, we must also train ourselves physically so that anger is only a threat based on the physical state of the world, and not your intentions. We will not succumb to the cowardice of the whiner. We should be jogging and lifting and meditating and just generally getting jacked and centered all the time.
</p>
<p>
If we want to be even  more efficient, we can designate someone in the group to be the jacked and thoughtful one. They can train all day, and then you can all go out with your friend to bars and stuff, and if a bad situation comes up you can just retreat behind your big strong friend and hope they can settle things for you. We will not succumb. 
</p>
<p>
It would serve ducks well to design a system supporting at least one duck champion per pond. No duck violence would need to happen. If there had been a shredded, sweaty duck in my backyard, glaring at the house all the time, I would never have gone out and gotten bitten in the first place.
</p>
<p>
So, don't be a jerk, but you should get swole and like, super stoic, so you can just be the rock for all your friends to rely on, and nobody will get hurt.
