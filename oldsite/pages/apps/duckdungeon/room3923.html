<h2>In the Duck Dungeon</h2>
<br>
<p>
Ok. You're in the first room of the duck dungeon. One of the ducks has taken a liking to you and follows you around. You have a feeling the duck will continue following you wherever you go.</p> <img src='sittingduck.png'><p>It looks like it's sitting, but it's only sitting when you are looking at it, and you can hear it walking when you're not looking, so don't worry about it anymore.</p>

<br><br>A torchlit hallway extends to the <a href='room456.html'>east</a>.<br>
