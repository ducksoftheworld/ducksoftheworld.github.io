	<h1>Draw an Ampersand yourself</h1> 
	<h2>Believe in your future</h2>
	<p>I have intentionally omitted an ampersand on this page so you can try to access your muscle memory, instead of copying one you can see. Click anywhere in the region below to start drawing!! If you fill up the page and need to try again, just reload the page (f5, or command-r on a Mac, or control-r on a PC. I don't remember Linux or any others, like on a phone.). If you think you've got it, just draw a checkmark, and then hit the X on the tab or window. Clicking the X is like you've acknowledged that you've done it!
