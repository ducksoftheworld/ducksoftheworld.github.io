<h1>Count Duckula and the Ancient Mystery</h1>

Duckula was a strange choice in a bunch of ways. Someone thought it was brilliant to make a cartoon show about a vegetarian but vampiric duck. How does that work? How did this come to be?

<p>
In my youth, I probably saw Duckula on the TV once or twice, but it burned into my head quite effectively. Every day I see Duckula as a shifting demon on the inside of my skull, briefly flitting into view and just as soon, gone again, unseen but not unheard, laughing down the cold cement steps into the cellar of my mind. Duckula!! I often thought of the Duckula cartoon, in particular the opening. There's a song at the beginning and it sings about Duckula. They made him nicer than he had been before.
</p>
<p>
Ok so here's the story, about Duckula. Count Duckula was an antagonist in the British cartoon show, Danger Mouse. Danger Mouse was a cute mouse who did secret spy style of things. I never watched Danger Mouse but I have heard one person I trust say it was a good show. So Danger Mouse had a character in it named Count Duckula, and Duckula wanted to be on TV, I think. Later Nickelodeon wanted to help pay for a show and they went to the office of Danger Mouse and they saw a picture of Duckula there, and they said, let's do Duckula. So they made Duckula, and then later I saw it on TV myself. He's a vegetarian so the kids aren't too scared. I don't really know what Duckula got up to but he had a butler and some other giant bird with him too, that kind of took care of him. I guess they were like the creators' way of making Duckula seem big and cool but also relatable, because he had parents.
</p>
<p>
So Duckula was on my mind a lot as a kid. Mostly, I think I had seen it in such an early time of my life, and so infrequently, that, I wasn't sure if it was real or not. If Duckula wasn't real, then maybe it was just a dream I had as a young kid.
</p>
<p>
I remember a dream, long ago, in my Grandparent's spare room that they kept the treadmill and the hunting stuff and my Grandpa's 50-cent American coin collection, we set up the crib so I could sleep over. In the night I had an awful dream. I was outside of a house, on the street, in the dark. The home was near the interface between rural land and suburban. In my head, I knew it was a house that was right next to our church that we would go to on Sundays. It was the middle of the night, and very scary. The house is narrow, and pointy on the top, with faded white siding and dark gray, sharply sloped shingles. Oh boy, it's spooky like a witch's house!! I walked up the wooden steps onto the porch and opened up the door, and went in, and inside, was a black hallway, with pale red-orange wallpaper and molding. Oh sppooky. The inside was just a hallway stretching away from the front door, with this wallpaper, but also MASKS on the wall, where they were hung up. These are spooky masks, I'll tell you.
</p>
<p>
They're illuminated from behind with the same red-orange light.
</p>
<p>
I walk down the hallway and past the gauntlet of eyeless masks. All variants on the comedy/tradgey masks from theater. You know what I'm talking about. These are not fun, and very scary. I'm scared in this dream, if you couldn't tell. The hallway opens up into a spooky slightly more open room, but not that much bigger, with all the same decoration and color choices, and in front of me is a GIANT mask of the same type, and it is facing me and smiling, and then it MOVES and moves TOWARD ME. HOLY COW!
</p>
<p>
I woke up in the crib and was aspooked. I looked at the thin blue curtains lit by the streetlights for a while.
</p>
<p>
I bet that mask was influenced a bit by Super Mario 2, which my cousin had on her Nintendo, which had a really scary mask that would float around and attack you, even if you went into a different room.
</p>

<p>
That's the mask, and it is friggin spooky. Super Mario Brothers 2 in English was another game in Japan, where they used to make the video games, called Doki Doki Panic, which was about people in the Middle East. They just took the game and made new pictures for it, and called it Super Mario from the USA. Kinda goofy!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, so the intro to the Duckula could have  been a dream as far as I knew it. It could have been some weird thing I dreamed up, but then many many years later we had the internet and I was able to look up that Duckula had been a real thing! Years and years later it was easy to watch videos on the internet and I tried watching an episode of Duckula, but it was hard because I was an adult who had adult kind of things to get done all day instead of watching cartoons like an idiot.
</p>
<p>
The time in between was a strange time of uncertainty. Not knowing what sang from my mind-head and what was real doesn't feel good. I didn't know if Duckula was real. I knew the dream wasn't real, yet it horrified me so much and felt so real. Have you ever felt the terror of your own mind? Or do you run from it? You are thinking of your grocery list. You are thinking of your date later. You are thinking of your work due on Tuesday. How can you get it all done? You fixate on these ideas to avoid thinking about the truth: that your mind is <i>nuts</i> and you're going <i>nuts</i> and it's not good at all. Were the dreams REAL or not?? How can you say it wasn't <i>real?</i> I need to take a break.
</p>
<p>
Another one of these things that I thought of was about a Tazmanian Devil toy I had as a kid. Actually, I think it was given to me by the neighbor's kid, Christopher, when he got too old for a few of his toys. He also gave me this awesome Castle Greyskull playset that I didn't know how to appreciate at the time. Castle Grayskull was a big scary castle, but I think it was good in the end, because Prince whatever lived there, and he was He-Man, and he was good, and Skeletor lived in another place which WASN'T named after a skull, even though Skeletor WAS a skeleton, a blue skeleton with tattered clothes, and he was some kind of sorcerer. He wanted to take Castle Grayskull from Prince Harry because it gave him the power to say by the power of Greyskull!! and his cat would turn into a giant tiger. Skeleton wanted a giant tiger. There was also Mumra which was spooky and then there was Hordak who was just a true nightmare. Oh my goodness.
</p>
<p>
So I think I also got this small Taz the Tazmanian Devil toy which was probably just a McDonalds toy. It came with a little red spandex kind of style suit that split into a front part and a back part, and fit together with these little plastic protrusions that fit into little holes on the other one. It might have been supposed to look like a super hero, like the flash, or some kind of Tazmanian Devil superhero. Taz being the Flash would make a lot of sense, since they both run around with lots of energy.
</p>
<p>
In retrospect, Taz was a <i>really</i> strange character. It was a hungry dog that turned into a tornado? and just spun around? That is a weird choice to spend all that time animating back when animating took more work than it does now. The point is, I don't know if that toy really existed or not.
</p>
<p>
We had a back deck that we replaced the wood on when I was a teenager. My mom found a Bib Fortuna toy underneath, in the mud, that had been there throughout my life. It must have been left there by the previous owners. It was worn but clearly recognizable as the guy with big pink head tentacles crawling down his neck like a total pointy toothed freakshow. that was cool, but for some reason I got really excited that the Taz toy would have been under there, too. I didn't find it. I looked around in the basement to see if I could find any of my old toys, but didn't see a Taz amongst the Power Rangers Zords. God those Zords ruled. They were HUGE city defending ROBOTS full of cool pizza eating TEENS.
</p>
<p>
If I had found that Taz toy anywhere, it would have provided some closure. The end of a story I didn't know was being written. I <i>had</i> had the Tazmanian Devil. It hadn't been a dream. I <i>had</i> watched a show about a cartoon vampire duck eating a carrot. These are the ancient mysteries of our past. Another ancient mystery I had was about a show about little gnome kids that I watched with my sister as a kid. I remember the little boy elf kid eating a giant strawberry with giant mouth. For decades I thought this had been a dream, and when I brought it up people thought I was just thinking of David the Gnome. But it WASN'T David the Gnome. I knew. I knew it wasn't David the Gnome, in my heart. All along it had been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl5DZIIs6R4">The Littl' Bits</a>. This is not the same as a show within a show in the cartoon Rick and Morty called Little Bits, <a href="https://youtu.be/Gj4-E5Hs3Kc">which is also a type that you can see</a>.
</p>

<p>
So, there are these ancient childhood mysteries. Were they a dream, or were they not a dream? I think I have cleared up most of my mysteries, except for the Tazmanian Devil one, which I am still not sure if I played with it on the cold basement floor or not still.
</p>

<p>
Don't worry too much about it, because Duckula was real, as in a real show, but not the character, and I guess it was fine. The thing about Duckula, is, I think it made me kind of uncomfortable as a kid, because the real like backgrounds, along with Count Duckula's buffoonery, and his stringy greasy parted hair made me feel like it was actually a show for adults. It may not have been very good, either, which means I might have thought I must have been missing jokes that were meant for adults.
</p>

<p>
Duckula!!
</p>

<p>
What are your ancient mysteries? Did you solve any of them? I do hope so.
</p>

<p>
OH MY GOSH. Oh my gosh. I just remembered another one. That I still haven't solved!! This is the big one. This is the big ancient mystery. So I think we got these shareware disk bundles from the computer store, and from Mac Addict magazine, and they had lots of games on them that were just kind of crappy, like they could have been someone's project for school, but a lot of them were great. One of them was <a href="https://obscuritory.com/mac/grizzly/">Grizzly</a>, which made me <i>very</i> uncomfortable in the same way Duckula did, but to much more of a higher degree. I did not like Grizzly because of the feeling it gave me, which was not a good feeling in my belly. But now it's good to think about.
</p>

<p>
Anyway so we got these shareware things and one of them was a hypercard game, which is like a visual novel now, with just pictures and texts. In one it was black and white, except there was a pink gorilla being kept in a cage in someone's house, and it escaped the house. I saw this once, but it burned into my mind like a ****er****er. Ugh. That pink gorilla! I have no idea what this game was or how I could possibly find it again. One of those CDs had hundreds of programs on them, and a special program on it to help you search through. What are the odds I'm the only person to have ever run The Pink Gorilla HyperCard Adventure? Maybe not too small.
</p>
<p>
I hope you can help me solve my pink gorilla mystery, as well as the Taz mystery, and can share with me your own Ancient Mysteries of Life by sending us an email at ducks of the world at ducksemailaddress.gmail.com. I'll be sure to get back to you.

<h2>Update: 3/13/21</h2>

<p>
We received a thoughtful commentary on this article from a concerned citizen and former child. It deserves to be shared with you now.

<blockquote>
<p>
I think Grizzly has the same quality you mention Duckula having. Namely, that as a kid you assumed you weren't getting it because you weren't old enough.
</p>

<p>
When the dark truth is that it just wasn't very good.
</p>

<p>
When you're a kid, art isn't delineated by quality, but rather by accessibility. There's the things you can understand, and the things you can't. But when you're young, the list of things you're able to grasp expands every single day. It gives you a strong sense of progression. Art is split into two categories: Good and Not Good Yet. 
</p>

<p>
As far as you know, one day you're going to wake up, fire up Grizzly, and master the one hit K.O. midair kick on that horrible floppy limbed antelope. It's just going to click for you. Grizzly <i>is</i> a good game. You just don't know how to play it yet. So you play not because it's fun, but because of that fleeting sense of maturity. Of brushing fingertipes with your older self, who's joined the ranks of adults who actually enjoy dark and gritty games like Grizzly with its jerky, violent character movement and a soundtrack that intersperses synthesized gutteral yells completely at random.
</p>

<p>
This is a grown ass game for grown ass people, and any minute now its depths will reveal themselves to you.
</p>

<p>
It's just a matter of time.
</p>
