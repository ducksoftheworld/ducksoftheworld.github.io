Take a look at this website.

So what's the deal here? The dress ruffled some feathers? Why? Why would people be annoyed about a dress that looks like a swan. The egg thing is silly. But isn't that the point here? She's just having fun. This made huge waves? What a boring world these movie people must lead if this is like a shocking thing.
</p>
<p>
I'll tell you what, if I were working for Huffington Post or The Soup, and it was my job to evaluate dresses at an awards show, I'd be all like, haha, that's cute! What a cute dress she's wearing. Ok look at that. Ok there she goes! Let's see who else is coming to the party!!

I would take a break for the eggs, but why let that bother anyone? Joan Rivers is a comedian. She was probably saying what she said in a silly way. Anyone who actually has judgemental feelings about this dress has got to reevaluate their priorities. How could I even write for The Soup about this? People get paid to write about mild reactions of celebrities about other celebrities' clothes at a party they all went to? And that means it's profitable and lots of people want to pay (albeit indirectly) to read about this? And this particular dress was so wild that they're still talking about it 16 years later? How is this even a cultural "thing."

<p>
The video ends reiterating that it was a faux pas. How? The page is called "How" the dress made history. How did it do it, then? All you DESCRIBED about it was how people reacted to it and also the egg thing.

I find myself dismayed by this video article.

Listen, either these writers are completely deluded about what is important or harmful in life, or they are <em>actively lying</em> about the importance of this dress to trick others into delusion. The former simply means that delusion is slightly more widespread. The latter implies something darker. From complete non-news, someone has crafted a spider's web of opiate bull-honkey to make a buck.
</p>

Ok, so I don't really believe in any goofball conspiracies about this dress or Hollywood culture at large. But it's like, dude?? There's gotta be more interesting things to occupy your mind with, you dig? Like, jeez. Stop wasting your time and just enjoy looking at the dress and seeing this artist enjoy the dress and that's it. Then start thinking about more important stuff.

Did you know? Swans share the same family as ducks, <i>Anatidae</i>, and comprise the subfamily <i>Cygninae</i>. In fact, ducks do not occupy a single subfamily, as the swans do, but are instead spread over several. These taxonomic classifications could let us loosen our restrictions and include swans on Ducks of the World articles. But let's get real. Even if we were staunchly against accepting swans as ducks, they would still deserve some of the time in the DotW spotlight. They are so majestic, Bj&#246;rk is a very interesting musician, and the dress is fine.
